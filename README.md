# GoogleCert

This is a small snippet of the activities I did during my journey to complete the Google CyberSecurity Professional Certificate. \n
I wanted to get this certification to solidify my CyberSecurity knowledge and skills, and to get more practice using Cyber related tools and writing reports. \n
This course has helped me deepen my understanding of the CyberSecurity field and I've been enjoying every part of this academic journey (I have really enjoyed hearing industry and career stories from Google employees)
